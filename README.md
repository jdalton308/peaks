# Peaks
The code assessment for TrainingPeaks.  It uses Gulp for a task-manager and npm for a dependency-manager.


### Development
**Install Dependecies**
After downloading, run `npm i`

**Local Dev**
Run `gulp` to start a file-watch task. Currently the node server is commented out so the PHP script can be tested, but to run a local server, uncomment the last line of the gulpfile, then run `gulp`, then visit `localhost:8000`
